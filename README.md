This is a framework that gives the potential for the monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy based on Analysis Ready Data (ARD) stored in the Open Data Cube (ODC)

It has a series of simple and fully automated function allowing users to work with the data without the need of writing complex code.

## Installation

There are a few, important steps to be done before the usage of notebooks

### Installation of Open Data Cube ### 

Make sure that you have installed the following:

* Python 3.6
* GDAL
* PostgreSQL database
* any other included in the requirements.txt

Afterwards, datacube has to be installed and configured. The full installation guide for ODC can be found here: https://datacube-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ops/install.html

abstract="Recently, massive amounts of satellite images are becoming available. The automated and efficient management, knowledge extraction and visualisation of these big earth data can enable the timely and comprehensive decision making in a number of operational scenarios. In this work, we demonstrate DataCAP that combines the Open Data Cube (ODC) technology on Satellite Image Time-series (SITS), with Machine Learning (ML) pipelines and crowdsourced street-level images to assist in the monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). DataCAP offers a suit of processing tools to simply and intuitively search, store and analyse radar and optical satellite images, along with visualisation tools that combine satellite and street-level imagery for the visual verification of algorithmic decisions.",
